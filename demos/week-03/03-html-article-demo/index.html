    <p>From friendships to salary negotiations, 2020 can be the year you conquer work and your career. Taking hold of your future begins with standing up for yourself, while also learning to navigate the complicated world of office politics.

      <body>
          <p>As many as a <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/guides/year-of-living-better/how-to-create-a-better-work-environment>third of United States workers</a> say they don't feel engaged at work. The reasons vary widely, and everyone's relationship with work is unique. But there are small ways to improve any job, and those incremental improvements can add up to major increases in job satisfaction.</p>
          <p>In fact, one study found that changing even just a small portion of what makes up your job can have a major impact on your overall happiness. In other words: You don't need to change everything about your job to see substantial benefits. A few changes here and there can be all you need. <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-be-happier-at-work.html>Read more>></a></p>

      <p>In the past two decades, a movement to play to our strengths has gained momentum in the world of work. It's a travesty that many people are fixated solely on repairing their weaknesses and don't have the chance to do what they do best every day. But it's a problem that many people aren't thoughtful about when to do what they do best. <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/smarter-living/how-your-strengths-can-make-you-weaker.html>Read more >></a></p>

    <body>
      <p>When things go right, we’re generally pretty good at identifying why they went right — that is, if we even take time to analyze the success at all. Preparation, proper scheduling, smart delegation and so on. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But falling on our face gives us the rare opportunity to find and address the things that went wrong (or, even more broadly, the traits or habits that led us to fail), and it’s an opportunity we should welcome. <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html>Read more >></a></p>

      <p>Gossip at work is common, as is the desire to be a part of a group. In a new work environment, this combination can be harmful if you fall in with colleagues who are <a href=https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-next-time-you-want-to-complain-at-work-do-this-instead>known for being negative and wasting productive time.</a></p>
      <p>While <a href=https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/how-complaining-turns-co-workers-into-friends.html>complaining with co-workers</a> can turn some of these colleagues into friends, <a href=http://www.jilljacinto.com/>Jill Jacinto</a>, a millennial career expert, said it’s best to avoid gossip altogether.</p>
      <p>“If someone asks, ‘What do you think of Mark? Have you worked with him yet?’ just focus on the professional,” she said. “‘He’s great to work with. He seems to know technology really well.’” <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/smarter-living/how-to-answer-tricky-personal-questions-at-a-new-job.html>Read more>></a></p>
